# GRC-GearApp
app to track gear donations, loans, locations, and condition for Girls Rock Columbia(SC).

App deets:
 we currently are doing very little to track loaned and donated gear leading to a bit of chaos during camps and events.

 ##USER STORIES
 ###As a loaner/donor:
 1. I can donate gear to GRC by giving basic info(name, address, value).
 2. I can receive an email tax receipt for said donation, if desired.
 3. I can loan gear to GRC for a specific period of time by giving basic info.
